# FileCMS (v0.3.7)

Simple PHP framework that builds HTML files from HTML widgets.
* Includes a class that can generate and validate CAPTCHAs (uses the GD extension).
* Includes the CKEditor for full-featured editing.
* Includes an email contact form that uses PHPMailer.
* Is able to import single files from a legacy website, or can do bulk import
* Includes a complete set of transformation filters that can be applied during import, or afterwards
* Entirely file-based: does not require a database!
* Includes classes that let you use a CSV file just like a database
* Very fast and flexible.
* Once you've got it up and running, just upload HTML snippets and/or modify the configuration file.
* Works on PHP 7.0 to 8.2

## Initial Installation
1. Clone the `filecms-website` repository to the project root of your new website.
  * If you have `git` installed run this command from a command prompt / terminal window:
```
git clone https://github.com/dbierer/filecms-website.git /path/to/website
```
  * If you don't have `git` installed, just download the ZIP file from:
```
https://github.com/dbierer/filecms-website/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```
  * And unzip into `/path/to/website`
2. Use composer to install `unlikelysource/filecms-core` and 3rd party source code (e.g. PHPMailer)
```
cd /path/to/website
wget https://getcomposer.org/download/latest-stable/composer.phar
php composer.phar self-update
php composer.phar install
```

## Basic website config
All references are from `/path/to/website`

* Primary config file: `/src/config/config.php`
* Bootstrap file: `/bootstrap.php`
* Pre-processing code: `/src/processing.php`

Additional documentation on these three follows.

## To Run Locally Using PHP

### Browser Access
To access from your browser:
```
http://localhost:8888/
```
* Or, if your IP addressing is working:
```
http://10.10.10.10/
```

## Bootstrap and Document Root
Set the website document root to `/public`
* The central point of entry is `/public/index.php`
* There is a file `.htaccess` that controls URL rewriting
* If you are using *nginx* you will need to incorporate the same logic into your primary config file
* `/public/index.php` first loads the *bootstrap* file `/bootstrap.php`
  * This file defines three key constants used throughout the program (summarized in the table shown next)
  * The bootstrap file also loads the Composer autoloader
  * If you add your own classes under `/src` be sure to update `composer.json` and refresh Composer autoloading:
```
composer dump-autoload
```
Here is a summary of the three key constants defined by `/bootstrap.php`.  Change as needed.

| Constant | Default | Description |
| :------  | :------ | :----------
| BASE_DIR | Same directory as `bootstrap.php` | Project root |
| HTML_DIR | `/templates/site` | Location of HTML snippets |
| SRC_DIR  | `/src` | Location of source code |

## Pre-Processing
Before the final HTML view is rendered, `/public/index.php` includes `/src/processsing.php`.
In this file you can include any pre-processing you need done.
* The request URL is available as the variable `$uri`
* This is where the admin URL (e.g. `/super`) is captured and sent to processing

## Templates
By default templates are stored in `/templates/site`.  You can alter this in the config file.
### Config File
Default: `/src/config/config.php`
* Delimiter: `DELIM` defaults to `%%`
* "Cards" `CARDS` defaults to `cards`
  * Represents the subdirectory under which view renderer expects to file HTML "cards"
### Layout
The overall website look-and-feel is in a single HTML file, by default in `/templates/layout/layout.phtml`.
* The view rendered by requests is injected into the layout by replacing `%%CONTENTS%%`.

### HTML
You can create HTML snippets designed to fit into `layout.phtml` any place in the designated HTML directory.
* Be sure to set the constant `HTML_DIR` in the file `/bootstrap.php`.

### Cards
Important: each `%%CARD%%` directive you add **must** be on its own line!

#### Auto-Populate All Cards
To get an HTML file to auto-populate with cards use this syntax:
```
DELIM+DIR+DELIM
```
Example: you have a subdirectory off `HTML_DIR` named `projects` and you want to load all HTML card files under the `cards` folder:
```
%%PROJECTS%%
```
#### Auto-Populate Specific Number of Cards
To only load a certain (random) number of cards, use `=`.
Example: you have a subdirectory off `HTML_DIR` named `features` and you want to load 3 random HTML card files under the `cards` folder:
```
%%FEATURES=3%%
```
#### Auto-Populate Specified Cards in a Certain Order
For each card, only use the base filename, no extension (i.e. do not add `.html`).
Example: you have a directory `HTML_DIR/blog/cards` with files `one.html`, `two.html`, `three.html`, etc.
You want the cards to be loaded in the order `one.html`, `two.html`, `three.html`, etc.:
```
%%BUNDLES=one,two,three,etc.%%
```

## Editing Pages
By default, if you enter the URL `/super/login` you're prompted to login as a super user.
Configure the username, password and secondary authentication factors in: `/src/config/config.php` under the `SUPER` config key.

### SUPER config key
Example configuration for super user:
```
// other config not shown
'SUPER' => [
    'username'  => 'REPL_SUPER_NAME',  // fill in your username here
    'password'  => 'REPL_SUPER_PWD',   // fill in your password here
    /*
     * extra login validation fields
     * change key/value pairs as desired
     * add as many as you want
     * they're selected at random when asked to login
     */
    'validation'   => [
        // if value is array, authentication needs to use "in_array()"
        'City'        => ['London','Tokyo'],
        'Postal Code' => 'NW1 6XE',
        'Last Name'   => ['Holmes','Lincoln'],
    ],
    'alt_logins' => [
        'REPL_OTHER_NAME' => [
            'username'  => 'REPL_OTHER_NAME',  // fill in alt username here
            'password'  => 'REPL_OTHER_PWD',   // fill in alt password here
        ],
        // add others as needed
    ],
    'attempts'  => 3,
    'message'   => 'Sorry! Unable to login.  Please contact your administrator',
    // reserved for future use:
    'allowed_ip' => ['10.0.0.0/24','192.168.0.0/24'],
    // array of $_SERVER keys to store in session if authenticated
    'profile'  => ['REMOTE_ADDR','HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'],
    // change the values to reflect the names of fields in your login.phtml form
    'login_fields' => [
        'name'     => 'name',
        'password' => 'password',
        'other'    => 'other',
        'phrase'   => 'phrase',     // CAPTCHA phrase
    ],
    // only files with these extensions can be edited
    'allowed_ext'  => ['html','htm'],
    'ckeditor'     => [
        'width'  => '100%',
        'height' => 400,
    ],
    'super_url'  => '/super',                // IMPORTANT: needs to be a subdir off the "super_dir" setting
    'super_dir'  => BASE_DIR . '/templates', // IMPORTANT: needs to have a subdir === "super_url" setting
    'super_menu' => BASE_DIR . '/templates/layout/super_menu.html',
    'backup_dir' => BASE_DIR . '/backups',
    'backup_cmd' => BASE_DIR . 'zip -r %%BACKUP_FN%% %%BACKUP_SRC%%',
],
// other config not shown
```
Here's a breakdown of the `SUPER` config keys

| Key | Explanation |
| :-- | :---------- |
| username | Super user login name |
| password | Super user login password |
| attempts | Maximum number of failed login attempts.  If this number is exceeded, a random third authentication field is required for login. |
| validation | Set of key:value pairs randomly selected each time you login. Values can be in the form of an array. |
| alt_logins | Additional usernames and passwords |
| message  | Message that displayed if login fails |
| profile  | Array of `$_SERVER` keys that form the super user's profile once logged in |
| login_fields | Field names drawn from your `login.phtml` login form |
| validation   | You can specify as many of these as you want.  If the login attemp exceeds `attempts`, the SimpleHtml framework will automatically add a random field drawn from this list. |
| allowed_ext  | Only files with an extension on this list can be edited. |
| ckeditor     | Default width and height of the CKeditor screen |
| super_* | Settings pertaining to the location of the super admin user URL, templates and menu |

## Contact Form
The skeleton app includes under `/templates` a file `contact.phtml` that implements an email contact form with a CAPTCHA
* Uses the PHPMailer package
* Configuration can be done in `/src/config/config.php` using the `COMPANY_EMAIL` key
* CAPTCHA configuration can be done in `/src/config/config.php` using the `CAPTCHA` key

## Import Feature
You can enable the import feature by setting the `IMPORT::enable` config key to `TRUE`.
The importer itself is at `/templates/site/super/import.phtml`.
Selected transformation filters can be applied to one or more pages during the import process.

Here are some notes on config file settings under the `IMPORT` config key:
* `IMPORT::enable`
  * Set this value to `FALSE` if you do not wish this feature to be available.
* `IMPORT::delim_start`
  * tells the importer where to start cutting out content from the HTML source
  * default: &lt;body&gt;
* `IMPORT::delim_stop`
  * tells the importer where to stop cutting out content from the HTML source
  * default: &lt;/body&gt;
* `IMPORT::trusted_src`
  * list of one or more prefixes from "trusted" sources for import
  * allows you to limit where imports can be taken from
  * in case you get hacked, this prevents attackers from importing malicious from their own sites
* `IMPORT::import_file_field`
  * this file must be in JSON format
  * name of the file upload field used in the form
  * you can upload a list of URLs to import followed by a list of transforms to apply
    * the URLs key is 'URLS'
    * the 'IMPORT' key lets you override any Import configuration including the transforms to apply during import
* `IMPORT::transform`
  * sub-array of transforms to make available to the importer
  * `callback` : anything that's callable
    * if your own PHP function or anonymous function, signature must match `SimpleHtml\Transform\TransformInterface`
  * `params` : array of parameters the callback expects
  * `description` : shows up when you run `/super/import`
After logging in as the admin user, go to `/super/import`.

## Transform Feature
You can apply transformation filters on existing pages.
The importer itself is at `/templates/site/super/import.phtml`.
Included transformation classes are located in `/src/Transform`.
You can add your own by simply extending `FileCMS\Common\Transform\Base`.
After logging in as the admin user, go to `/super/transform`.

Here are some notes on config file settings under the `TRANSFORM` config key:
* `TRANSFORM::enable`
  * Set this value to `FALSE` if you do not wish this feature to be available.
* `TRANSFORM::backup_dir`
  * Directory where backups will be placed prior to transformation
* `TRANSFORM::transform_dir`
  * Directory where transform classes are found
* `TRANSFORM::transform_file_field`
  * Name of the form field that is used if you want to upload a set of transforms

## Clicks
A class `FileCMS\Common\Stats\Clicks` was added as of version 0.2.1.
Records the following information into a CSV file:
* URL
* Date
* Time
* IP address
* Referrer
* 1
The "1" can be used in a spreadsheet to create totals by any of the other fields.
After logging in as the admin user, go to `/super/clicks`.
### Statistical Methods
The following methods are available for your use:
#### Clicks::get(string $click_fn) : array
Returns an array keyed and sorted by URL, with hit grand totals.
#### Clicks::get_by_page_by_day(string $click_fn) : array
Returns an array keyed and sorted by URL + Y-m-d, with hit totals for each day
#### Clicks::get_by_path(string $click_fn, string $path) : array
Returns the same as `get_by_page_by_day()` except that it filters results based on `$path`.
Use this to return stats on URLs such as `/practice/dr_tom/`.

## CSV
You can use a CSV file just like a database using either the `FileCMS\Common\Data\Csv` or `FileCMS\Common\Data\BigCsv` classes
* `FileCMS\Common\Data\Csv`
  * Use this for small CSV files (less than 10 MB in size)
  * Fast performance
  * Uses a lot of memory
* `FileCMS\Common\Data\BigCsv`
  * Use this for large CSV files (greater than 10 MB in size)
  * Moderate performance
  * Uses very little memory
  * If your CSV file is greater than 10 MB in size use this class instead of `FileCMS\Common\Data\Csv`

### public function getItemsFromCsv($key_field = NULL) : array
* Gets list of items from CSV
* @param string|array $key_field : header(s) to use as key; leave blank for numeric array
* @return array $select : `[key => value]`; key === practice_key; value = $row
### public function writeRowToCsv(array $post, array $csv_fields = `[]`) : bool
* Writes row to CSV
* @param array $post       : normally sanitized $_POST
* @param array $csv_fields : array of CSV headers; leave blank if headers not used
* @return bool             : TRUE if entry made OK
### public function findItemInCSV(string $search, bool $case = FALSE, bool $first = TRUE) : array
* Finds key in CSV file
* Assumes first row is headers unless $first === FALSE
* Stores contents of CSV file in $this->lines
* If found, sets $this->pos to the line number of the row found in $this->lines
* @param string $search  : any value that might be in the CSV file
* @param bool $case      : TRUE: case sensitive; FALSE: `[default]` case insensitive search
* @param bool $first_row : TRUE `[default]`: first row is headers; FALSE: first row is data
* @return array
### public function updateRowInCsv(string $search, array $data, array $csv_fields = [], bool $case = FALSE) : bool
* Updates row in CSV file
* If you don't supply $csv_fields, assumes no headers
* If no headers, update does delete and then insert
* @param string $search  : any value that might be in the CSV file
* @param array $data     : array of items to update
* @param array $csv_fields : array of fields names; leave blank if you don't use headers
* @param bool $case      : TRUE: case sensitive; FALSE: `[default]` case insensitive search
* @return bool             : TRUE if entry made OK
